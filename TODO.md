- Order this list to kanban style
- Improve AI that solved the game
    - determine how many high values are on the side and in the middle, and determines with which movement the highest values get to or from the side. Or even better, determine if the values are in consecutively order.
    - Use the amount of empty tiles after movement as reference
- Improve the game winning printing
- Improve the gui
- Add timer
- Add highscore
    - Add log file
    - Add highscores.json
- Add hinting in manual mode
- Add multithreading
- Add map structure to README
- Rewrite code in rust? ^^

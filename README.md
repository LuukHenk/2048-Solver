# Twenty-Forty-Eight
#### Version 0.4.0
2048 is a simple numberbased board game with a 4x4 board. All the values on the board are two or a squired form of two. Values can be merged when equal by moving the values over the board using [w, s, a, d]. The goal of the game is to obtain a value of 2048. More info about the game [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)).
